Angular 18 introduced a new feature called Control Events. Control Events are a way to listen to events on a form control. This is useful when you want to listen to events on a form control and react to them. It provides the following events:

- ValueChangeEvent 
- StatusChangeEvent
- PristineChangeEvent
- TouchChangeEvent
