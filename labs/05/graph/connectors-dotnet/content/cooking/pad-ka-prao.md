If you're curious, I address the reason behind all these different spellings in the FAQ of my traditional beef pad kra pao recipe post. (For the record "pad gaprao" is, I think, the most phonetically correct way to spell it, but because pad kra pao is the most popular and recognizable, I've chosen to use that spelling here.)

I know many Thai people would agree with me that if Thailand were to have a national dish, it should not be pad thai, it should be pad kra pao. It is universally loved, frequently consumed by the rich and poor alike. It's something people buy on the street, in restaurants, and make at home. It is just a big part of the Thai food culture.

Ingredients
Here are the ingredients with all the important notes you'll need before you start. Remember that this is supposed to be a formula that you can adapt to any kind of protein you have that you want to use, even leftover cooked meat! The amounts are in the recipe card below.

Any kind of protein, raw or cooked. This is a great recipe for using up any meat, including leftover cooked meats like that Thanksgiving turkey, roast beef, or anything else you've got on hand. You can also use tofu, but pleasr see my tips for tofu below.
Spicy red chilies, such as Thai or bird's eye chilies. Pad kra pao is supposed to be a spicy dish so put as many chilies as you can tolerate here! If you're unsure, and you're tolerance isn't super high, start with 1 Thai chili to be safe.
Mild red chilies, such as spur chilies. Traditionally we use spur chilies of prik chee fa, but this can be any kind of mild red peppers you have. Red bell pepper is a bit too watery than idea, but it'll work if that's all you have. If you're making this super hot and are already adding tons of spicy chilies (like at least 5 Thai chilies) you do not have to add any mild ones.
Garlic.
Onion, small dice. This is optional, and you can substitute it with any other crunchy vegetables you've got in the fridge. My other favorite veg to add is long beans.
Holy basil, Italian basil or Thai basil leaves. Holy basil (pictured) is the namesake of this dish, but it is super hard to find, and when you do find it, it's often not very aromatic. Italian basil is my preferred substitute because it is a closer flavour match than Thai basil, but Thai basil will also work if you love that flavour.
Oyster sauce. See my post on choosing good oyster sauce here.
Soy sauce. I use Healthy Boy Thai soy sauce, but any regular soy sauce you have is fine. More on soy sauces here.
Fish sauce. See my post on how to choose good fish sauce here.
Thai black soy sauce or dark soy sauce, optional. This is to add colour and a richer flavour, but it is not necessary.
Water
Sugar
Vegetable oil, as needed
Eggs for frying, optional. Pad kra pao is often serve with fried eggs and they go super well together, but it is not necessary if you're looking for a quick simple meal! But if you're serving fried eggs, you're gonna want to make this simple prik nam pla condiment for it too ðŸ˜‰
Jasmine rice for serving, of course!
