# Extending Copilot for Microsoft 365

The course is divided into seven modules, each covering a different aspect of Copilot for Microsoft 365. 

Introduction: This module provides an overview of the Microsoft 365 platform, including apps, extensions, and Copilot. It also covers development tools and environment setup, Microsoft Entra ID, and app registrations.

Consuming Graph & OpenAPI in Azure Functions: This module covers the basics of consuming Microsoft Graph & OpenAI in Azure Functions (Python / Node). It introduces common Graph endpoints (files, mail, calendar, contacts, Teams, SharePoint, Planner), as well as Change Notifications. We learn how to implement a custom Graph Connector, that we will use later on in Copilot. 

Microsoft Teams Extension Patterns: This module covers building apps for Microsoft Teams, including an overview of the Teams Developer Portal, introduction to Teams Developer Toolkit, tabs in Microsoft Teams, collecting input with task modules, task-oriented interactions with messaging extensions, and building API-based message extensions.

Using Copilot for Microsoft 365 Office in Apps & Teams: This module provides an overview of Copilot for Microsoft 365, including Copilot prompts and using Copilot in Office Apps & Teams.

Implementing Plugins for Copilot for Microsoft 365: This module covers Copilot for Microsoft 365 plugins, plugin architecture, message extensions for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, building plugins using Microsoft Business Applications, Graph Connectors API & Copilot for Microsoft 365, and implementing a Microsoft Graph Connectors for Copilot for Microsoft 365.

Teams Apps & Copilot Plugins Deployment: This module covers app deployment options, Microsoft 365 CLI & Microsoft 365 Desired State Configuration, publishing Microsoft Teams apps, introduction to Azure Container Apps, deploying containers using Azure DevOps, and publishing API-based message extensions to Azure Container Apps.

Create copilots with Azure AI Studio: This module is an introduction to Azure AI Studio & the Microsoft Copilot ecosystem, prompt flows & embeddings, introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and RAG-based Copilots. Azure AI Studio brings together various AI services within the Azure cloud platform, providing a unified experience for AI development
