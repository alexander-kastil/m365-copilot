<p>This sample uses the OAuth2.0 auth code flow and requires a tenant admin to authorize the app to access the resources in the tenant. The sample redirects to the <i>adminconsent</i> endpoint so an admin can consent to the required permission.</p>
<p>This sample supports both a user delegated context (the calls to the Graph will be made on behalf of the currently signed-in user) and app only context (the calls to the graph will be made as the application without carrying any user identity).</p>
<p>For a list of supported resources and supported contexts, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http#permissions">documentation</a></p>
